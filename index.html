                      Instagram is
                      a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
                      friends and family.

                      Take a picture or video, choose a filter
                      to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram
                      &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook,
                      Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.
